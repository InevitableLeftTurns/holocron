Defeat 500 Enemies: Ignore. This is a freebie that you'll get just by playing.

Win 40 battles with Unaligned Force User teams:

- Inks: GI / 7th / 8th / 5th / 9th. Doubles up with blind in sector 1, health steal in sector 2, purge in sector 3, stealth in sector 4, defeat enemies with inks in sector 5, and armor shred in sector 5. With Amplify Agony, this team demolishes a lot of squads, especially Jedi and Geos.

- Rey: Rey / JTR / Scav / Hobo Ben / Visas. Doubles up with ability block in sector 4. Very good vs. Jawas, Ewoks, Imp Troopers, Padme, GAS.

- SLKR: SLKR / KRU / Kylo / SK / Maul. This team doesn't have great utility down the stretch, but for the first couple of days they're great.

It's possible to make other teams, but the above 3 are who I use.

40 wins with Daka / Talzin / Merrin in your team: (This feat requires all three to survive)

- Talzin / Daka / Merrin / Zombie / Asajj. Even if your NS kinda stink, you can just roll with them. Seriously. Take this team against inks in sector 2. You need the following, truly onerous gear levels: G11 Talzin, Daka, Zombie, and Asajj, g8 Merrin. Now, I recommend at least g12 for the first 4 and g9 for Merrin, but you do you. Anyway, this is an unbelievably easy matchup. Credit to my guild mate RtuaDetoa for this one. This also counts for plagues and "no attackers" because somehow Asaaj is support. Wild. of note: Don't try this until you've got good data discs. Once you have great data discs, this team can beat the Tusken bonus fight at the end of sector 4. You'll want the G12-ish (g9 merrin) version of the team for that.

- Talzin / Daka / Merrin / JML / Wat. This is my preferred cheese team for this feat until I get good data discs (I have g12 Talzin, g12 Daka, g8 3 star Merrin). Fight a MM team. Bonus: Use this team in sector 2 and it counts for both "no attackers" and "apply purge" feats on top of the global to win with these three NS alive.

- SLKR / KRU / Daka / Talzin / Merrin. This team will work against any team without AoE, like Tuskens or some Phoenix squads. SLKR is the hammer, KRU is the anvil, and the three NS just stand back and try not to get hurt. This is fine until you get good data discs.

Win 20 Battles with 0-0-0 and BT-1 in your squad:

- 5OR-T / BT-1 / 0-0-0 / BB8 / 3PAC. Pretty decent team in conquest, great for blinds in sector 1, plus secret intel for sector 1. Also good for droid kills when you need those.

- JKL murderdroids cheese. See the separate cheese strategy post linked at the top of this guide.

20 wins with a full squad of Tusken:

- Chieftain / Warrior / UR / Shaman / Raider. Even if your tusken SUCK, (3 star g9 cheif / g12 UR / g12 Raider / g12 Shaman / 3 star g9 warrior) they are able to win against imp troopers in sector 1 (data discs definitely help). Some will die so these aren't 3 star victories, but it's enough that you can complete the feat. I've heard they work against JTR as well, but I have yet to test that. The chief's leader zeta is required. Mon Mothma and Ewok teams are also really good targets for this team.

Defeat 100 enemies with Cal or Cere:

I'm assuming everyone's Cal and Cere suck (3 star, g8).

- Here's the cheese strat I used, courtesy of u/chabadaprime:

Call Allies to Assist with Booming Voice 60 Times: No special team needed. I got about 25 of these calls while doing the stealth cheese in sector 4 (see below).

Gain Massively Overpowered 20 Times: No special team needed.

----

@@SECTOR 1

Kill 50 enemies with Jedi:

- JML cheese (see link at top).

Gain Secret intel 80 times:

- 5OR-T / BB8 / BT-1 / 0-0-0 / 3PAC. Double up with 3PAC applying evasion down on basic and blind on 1st special, and with the global feat to win using BT-1 and 0-0-0 in your team. Since JML is busy getting jedi kills, this is a good way to keep progress moving on that feat at the same time. I get about 20 secret intels per battle with this team.

Inflict Evasion Down 40 times:

- See above. If you don't have the above options, a standard CLS team including 3PAC will get this feat done for you quickly.

Blind 60 times:

- See above. If you don't have the above options, a standard CLS team including 3PAC will get this feat done for you quickly.

Sector 1 Bosses:

Sector 1 Miniboss - Win with Hermit Yoda surviving: JML cheese (see link at top)

Sector 1 Miniboss - Win without force users: Imp troopers are my go-to here. GG sep droids also work. The 5OR-T team above worked very well for this (G12 5OR-T / r7 BB8 / r6 3PAC / g8 murderdroids).

Sector 1 End Boss - Win without a GL: This is actually win with no force users.

Sector 1 End Boss - Win with T3M4 surviving: JKL cheese (see link at top).

----

@@SECTOR 2

No Attackers:

- Veers / Piett / Gideon / Range / Starck is one of my favorite teams for this. Remember to save this team for both the midboss and endboss fights.

- Padme / GK / R2D2 / C3PO / GMY is also a great team for this, and doubles up with evasion as GMY spreads foresight to the whole team (and R2 can also apply it every now and then).

- Talzin / Daka / Merrin / JML / Wat. This team counts for "no attackers" and will inflict plague (see below), plus it counts for the NS Trio global feat. Fight against a MM team and you're in great shape. Credit to u/Loocha for the strategy!

- Talzin / Daka / Merrin / Asajj / Zombie. Fight inks; their initial debuffs will get Merrin her turn asap and start the ball rolling. Requires good data discs, but not good NS.

Health Steal up 20 times:

- EP / 4 more sith or empire characters: EP gives your whole team health steal with his 3rd ability, so use that early and often and this feat is cake.

Inflict Plague 200 times:

- NS, obviously. See the global NS trio feat above for the various cheeses.

Evade 100 attacks in battles you won:

- Hopefully you get this just from using the padme team above. If not...

- Old Ben lead / Your tankiest GL(pref Rey) / Hoda / BB8 / JTR. Use the voluntary vanguard disc, and - if you have it - Quick Reflexes. Then go fight a Bo katan or Carth OR team. Since they AoE on every attack, and your entire team is high dodge characters, plus hoda auto-dodges everything while stealthed, plus you get a ton of dodges from quick reflexes... I got over 26 dodges in one combat. It may have been many more, but I only needed 26 at that point so it's hard to say how many I really got. You do have to eventually win, though. Which is why a powerful GL helps so much here.

Sector 2 Bosses:

Sector 2 Miniboss - Win with Sana Starros surviving: JKL cheese (see link at top). Bring captain han in case sana dies. Standard Sana team works well, too, if you have it.

Sector 2 MiniBoss - Win without using Force Users of any kind: Imp Troopers crush this.

Sector 2 End Boss - Win with Cad and Aurra surviving: JKL cheese (see link at top).

Sector 2 End Boss - Win without using Force Users of any kind: Imp Troopers crush this. If your BH are very strong, you may be able to knock out both end boss feats with a single BH squad, though my BH are very strong and I couldn't keep them alive. GG also works well.

@@SECTOR 3

kill 50 enemies with droids: Lots of options here, from Farty to GG to just bringing CLS and hoping 3PAC gets the finishes. To cheese it out, look for MM teams so you can milk revives.

Gain Momentum 1000 times: There's a cheese strategy for completing this in a single battle courtesy of u/Gibsorz (post here):

"Go against a TM generation team. I picked Ewoks, best with elder for more TM generation.

Chieftain lead, zeta not required. 2 tuskens (urorrrr and shaman I chose), JML and wat. Put tank tech on JML and hit auto. If someone on the other side started to get low then switch targeting. Don't kill anyone.

By the time JMLs taunt drops there is so much momentum that the Ewoks do no damage to your tuskens. Modding? Don't worry about it. Shaman and chieftain are unmodded."

Attempt to Inflict Purge 300 Times:

- Inks. See the link at the top for a cheese strategy which will work even if you have 3-star, g8 inks.

Gain Foresight 60 times:

- JML cheese (see link at top) bringing GMY.

- Padme / GMY / R2D2 / C3PO / GK. Not as fast as above, but saves JML for the murderdroid cheese. Still very effective.

- JTR / BB8 / GMY / GK / R2D2. This is my ultimate foresight team. JTR and BB8 give each other foresight like crazy. GK gives himself foresight. And GMY and R2D2 give foresight to others. The only trick is that you need the data discs to enable this team to actually kill things. ZA or the VA/AA combo should do the trick.

Sector 3 Bosses:

Sector 3 Miniboss - Win with BFSoJ Surviving: JKL / JML. /Wat cheese.

Sector 3 MiniBoss - Win without using Force Users of any kind: Imp Troopers crush this.

Sector 3 End Boss - Win with Dr Aphra surviving: If you have her, just use her team.

Sector 3 End Boss - Win without a GL: (actually no force users).

----

@@SECTOR 4

Get 50 kills with Imp Troopers: You're goddamn right I will. Save them for the end boss fight and you can get all 50 kills in a single fight by abusing that poor zombie.

Inflict Ability Block 60 Times: Vader does this on basic, so a team like EP / Vader / Tarkin / MJ / Thrawn will get it done pretty quickly. But really a ton of characters apply ability block so just use whoever you like. I actually got a lot of credit towards this feat while doing the Cal kills global cheese with JML.

Gain Stealth 40 Times:

- Stealth Cheese (see link above).

- Darth Maul / 4 sith. Darth Maul's lead gives your sith stealth if they get critically hit or evade.

- Any team with R2D2. The smoke screen stealths 4 of your characters at a time.

Win 14 battles with a full squad of rebels:

- CLS / Han / Chewie / Old Ben / R2D2. Using R2 lets you double up with the stealth feat above, and Old Ben applies ability block to double dip with that. (thanks to u/knope2018 for suggesting old ben alongside the others for the triple dippage)

- Admiral Raddus / Jyn / Cassian / K2 / Bistan. The rogues are rebels, after all.

- MM / KK / Cara / Pao / Hoth Rebel Scout. Another possible rebel team.

Sector 4 Bosses:

Sector 4 Miniboss - Win with Cere Surviving: This is hard to do with JML cheese, so I use the Dash Nuke team (BAM lead / Dash / CAT -or- Kuiil if you don't have CAT / Han Solo / Cere). Gotta have VA / AA to make the TM train work, and there's a little bit of RNG if Piett gets his mass daze off, but I was able to 3-star this fight with this team (and my Cere is only 3-star g10).

Sector 4 MiniBoss - Win without using Force Users of any kind: GG was solid for this.

Sector 4 End Boss - Win with Darth Malgus and Sith Assassin surviving: JKL cheese or just DR lead sith empire.

Sector 4 End Boss - Win without using Force Users of any kind: Imp Troopers can do this and abuse the zombie to get all 50 kills they need in a single fight here.

----

@@SECTOR 5

Kill 50 Enemies with Inks:

- GI / 7th / 8th / 5th / 9th. If you don't have GI, use 5th as lead and bring 2nd along as well. If you don't have decent inks (probably most of you), you can cheese this with...

- Treya cheese.

Win 14 Battles with no Tanks:

- CLS / Han / Chewie / C3PO / 3PAC. Easy wins vs. Bad Batch, Inks, and a range of other teams.

- Rey / RH Finn / RH Poe / Scav / BB8. Solid tankless team if you have Rey.

- JMK / CAT / GAS / Ahsoka / Shaak. Solid tankless JMK team if you have him, double dips with armor shreds.

- Veers / Piett / Starck / Gideon / Range. The venerable imps also double dip with armor shred (Gideon).

- LV / 4 non tank guys LV is friends with. I've heard this works. I don't have LV so I can't test it.

- Maul Cheese

- Dash Nuke Cheese.

Inflict Armor Shred 20 Times:

- See above. Sabine also shreds, so if yours is good (mine isn't), you can toss her on a rebel team or just use PHX if your whole squad works. Finally, Fennec Shand shreds like a beast, so if you can get a BH squad going (with no tanks, even), she can help you out here. (Credit to u/RKNieen for letting me know)

Defense Up: CW Chewie Lead / Old Ben / K2SO / L3-37 / Scarif Rebel Pathfinder (or literally any other 4 tanks). Every time someone is damaged they have a 50% chance to gain defense up, so just send this team against something with a lot of AoE like an OR team and let them auto basic until it times out. Feat done in 1 combat.

Sector 5 Bosses:

Sector 5 MiniBoss - Win without using Force Users of any kind: I like Seps for this (GG / B1 / B2 / Nute / Magna). It's generally pretty effective. Imp Troopers also work well, but they might be tied up doing battles in earlier sectors for a while.

Sector 5 Miniboss - Win with Cal Kestis surviving: I guess bring him with your JKL cheese.

Sector 5 End Boss - Win with Admiral Trench surviving: If you followed my guide for the last set of conquests, you can do this! If not... well, you're S.O.O.L. on this one

Sector 5 End Boss - Win without using a GL: (actually no force users). The GG team is outstanding in this fight. Keep Rey stunned (you can!) and it's a cinch.
